# Factory design pattern

We have N number of services with the same methods, but the aim of this pattern is to create only one service that apply methods to the different classes based on the type that was provided to the factory class method.

## Running 
```bash
#go to the root project directory
$ cd path/to/project

#installing dependencies
$ npm install

#running the code 
$ npm start
```
